"""
You are designing a robot that can calculate the temperature
and guess the season. Write a Python program that takes a number
as input, representing the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, and
converts it into degrees Celsius, and then prints the season based
on the following table:

Temperature (degrees Celsius)	                       Season

Less than 20 degrees	                               Winter
Between 20 degrees and 25 degrees (inclusive)	       Autumn
Greater than 25 degrees and less than 30 degrees	   Spring
Greater than or equal to 30 degrees	                   Summer
==========================================================
Use the following formula to convert the temperature:
(degrees Celsius) = ((degrees Fahrenheit) - 32) * 0.56
==========================================================
Sample Input 1:
82
Sample Output 1:
28 degrees C
Spring
Explanation: The temperature in Celsius is (82 - 32) * 0.56 = 28 degrees,
which is printed. This is between 25 and 30 degrees, so “Spring” is printed after that.
==========================================================
Sample Input 2:
32
Sample Output 2:
0 degrees C
Winter
Explanation: The temperature in Celsius is (32 - 32) * 0.56 = 0 degrees,
which is printed. This is less than 20 degrees, so “Winter” is printed after that.
==========================================================
Sample Input 3:
76
Sample Output 3:
24.64 degrees C
Autumn
Explanation: The temperature in Celsius is (76 - 32) * 0.56 = 24.64 degrees,
which is printed. This is between 20 degrees and 25 degrees (inclusive),
so “Autumn” is printed after that.
==========================================================
Sample Input 4:
77
Sample Output 3:
25.2 degrees C
Spring
Explanation: The temperature in Celsius is (77 - 32) * 0.56 = 25.2 degrees,
which is printed. This is greater than 25 degrees and less than 30 degrees,
so “Spring” is printed after that.
