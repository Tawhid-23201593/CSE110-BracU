"""
Write the Python code of a program that reads an integer,
and prints the integer it is a multiple of either 2 or 5
but not both. If the number is a multiple of 2 and 5 both,
then print "Multiple of 2 and 5 both". For all other numbers,
the program prints "Not a multiple we want".
For example, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 22 â€¦ i.e.
this includes multiples of 2 only and multiples of 5 only,
NOT multiples of 2 and 5 both or other numbers.
